# __APP_NAME__

A Hono API created with [tatara](https://github.com/mohammed-bageri/tatara-cli).

## Getting started

```sh
__PM_RUN__ dev
```

This starts the local services, prepares the database and runs every process with
reload. Then open:

- API: http://localhost:3000/api
- API reference: http://localhost:3000/docs
- Health: http://localhost:3000/health
