# @tatara/authz

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 315003d: Operations. `@tatara/core`: a `deploy` command (commands with `phase: "deploy"` every deploy, `phase: "once"` once per database, recorded in a ledger; `db:migrate` runs first, `authz:sync-permissions` after), `createEncryption` (AES-256-GCM, rotatable keys), `randomCode`/`numericCode`/`randomToken`/`hashToken`/`safeEqual`, and `cleanText`/`safeUrl` with the `text()`/`url()` zod fields. `@tatara/db`: `commandLedger(url)` per driver; a Postgres reset also drops the `tatara` schema. New `@tatara/observability` and `observability` add-on: OpenTelemetry traces and metrics over OTLP/HTTP with auto-instrumentation, Hono request spans, trace ids on log lines, instrumented processes through `--import ./dist/apps/instrument.mjs`. Codemod 0.11.0 `deploy-ledger`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- b0727b7: The app owns its auth. Generated apps keep auth in `src/modules/users` (built with `createAuthInstance`), compose HTTP in `src/apps/http.ts`, and with the admin add-on get a `staff` module with its own better-auth. Requests name their org (`requireOrg()`, `x-org-id`); a Keycloak token's `organization` claim decides which orgs its user may act in; authz has no default org, so single-tenant apps set `singleTenant`. `tatara upgrade` moves existing apps (codemod 0.10.0). The MySQL test reset deletes rows instead of truncating.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fd669b1: Generated apps are smaller:
  - tatara's own wiring tests no longer go into apps; the e2e matrix runs them.
  - `@tatara/authz` ships the Prisma and Drizzle stores (`prismaAuthzStore(db)`, `drizzleAuthzStore(db, tables)`).
  - The db, authz, email, storage and jobs commands and seeds come from their packages. Packages declare them in a `"tatara"` field, and `tatara sync` wires them into `src/generated`. An app's own command with the same name wins.
  
  `tatara upgrade` now bumps every `@tatara/*` dependency to this CLI's version and installs before syncing. The 0.9.0 codemods remove the copies that are no longer needed.
