# @tatara/authz

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 03d1428: `authzPlugin`: someone invited as `owner` gets the creator's role when they accept.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 96f8522: `authzPlugin`: owners hold the creator's role. A member made `owner` later gets it, and an owner made `member` loses it. Authz roles given to someone who was never owner are left alone.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- d9f9578: Org access belongs to authz; better-auth's member role is membership only.
  
  - `authzPlugin(authz, options)` from `@tatara/authz/better-auth`: the creator of an org gets `admin`, a member removed or leaving loses their authz access, member roles are kept to `owner` and `member`, and `endpoints` puts better-auth's org endpoints behind authz permissions. Generated apps guard the member and invitation lists with `member:read`.
  - **Breaking:** built-in roles no longer follow better-auth's member role or user role. `SystemRole.heldBy` says who holds a role without an assignment: `"members"` (every member of the org) or `"identity"` (holders of that identity-provider role, e.g. `staff` or Keycloak roles). An org member's better-auth role `admin` no longer grants authz's `admin`.
  - `tatara upgrade` (0.13.0) adds `heldBy` to `member`, `staff`, and, in Keycloak apps, every role; it says how to move `auth.ts` to `authzPlugin`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d778b3: `authz.grantSystemRole(orgId, userId, key)`; generated apps with organizations make an org's creator its `admin` in their own `auth.ts` (and `authzOrganizationHooks` takes `creatorRole`). The notifier takes `allow({ userId, notification, channel, data })`, so the app decides who gets which channel. `sanitizeHtml` (`@tatara/core/html`, with `sanitize-html` installed). `tatara add <add-on…>` adds add-ons to an existing app. Observability registers in-thread ESM hooks (`module.registerHooks`) where Node has them, so Node 26 prints no deprecation; `@tatara/observability/hooks`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [0d778b3]
  - @tatara/core@0.1.3

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 315003d: Operations. `@tatara/core`: a `deploy` command (commands with `phase: "deploy"` every deploy, `phase: "once"` once per database, recorded in a ledger; `db:migrate` runs first, `authz:sync-permissions` after), `createEncryption` (AES-256-GCM, rotatable keys), `randomCode`/`numericCode`/`randomToken`/`hashToken`/`safeEqual`, and `cleanText`/`safeUrl` with the `text()`/`url()` zod fields. `@tatara/db`: `commandLedger(url)` per driver; a Postgres reset also drops the `tatara` schema. New `@tatara/observability` and `observability` add-on: OpenTelemetry traces and metrics over OTLP/HTTP with auto-instrumentation, Hono request spans, trace ids on log lines, instrumented processes through `--import ./dist/apps/instrument.mjs`. Codemod 0.11.0 `deploy-ledger`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- b0727b7: The app owns its auth. Generated apps keep auth in `src/modules/users` (built with `createAuthInstance`), compose HTTP in `src/apps/http.ts`, and with the admin add-on get a `staff` module with its own better-auth. Requests name their org (`requireOrg()`, `x-org-id`); a Keycloak token's `organization` claim decides which orgs its user may act in; authz has no default org, so single-tenant apps set `singleTenant`. `tatara upgrade` moves existing apps (codemod 0.10.0). The MySQL test reset deletes rows instead of truncating.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [b0727b7]
  - @tatara/auth@0.2.0
  - @tatara/db@0.2.1

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fd669b1: Generated apps are smaller:
  - tatara's own wiring tests no longer go into apps; the e2e matrix runs them.
  - `@tatara/authz` ships the Prisma and Drizzle stores (`prismaAuthzStore(db)`, `drizzleAuthzStore(db, tables)`).
  - The db, authz, email, storage and jobs commands and seeds come from their packages. Packages declare them in a `"tatara"` field, and `tatara sync` wires them into `src/generated`. An app's own command with the same name wins.
  
  `tatara upgrade` now bumps every `@tatara/*` dependency to this CLI's version and installs before syncing. The 0.9.0 codemods remove the copies that are no longer needed.
